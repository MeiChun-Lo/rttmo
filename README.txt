rttmo - real time tone mapping operator


uses a single usb or firewire camera


usb version: adjust the 'Makefile'


firewire version: adjust the 'remake' script


the tonemapping settings are in main.cpp, in the function 'runHDR'


results are limited by how well/fast the camera can change exposure (if at all)


see my website for More Info, and for the Android version:
